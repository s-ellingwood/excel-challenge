# Excel Challenge

## Project Background
### Background
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

### Data source:
All used data in this project is provided by UNC Chapel Hill’s Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp.

### Files:
- Crowdfunding Report.docx - contains a short analysis of the crowdfunding project data.
- CrowdfundingBook.xlsx - contains the original data as well as sheets for a category pivot table, sub-category pivot table, date created pivot table, an overall crowdfunding goal analysis, and a statistical analysis of backers for crowdfunding projects.
